# Tic-Tac-Toe
A python program to play Tic-Tac-Toe within any Terminal.

You can play two types of games:
	1. A single player game with Computer.
	2. A two players game with 2nd player alongside the 1st player.

Most of the implementation was based on my own understanding of the language and the game.
There are couple of implementations which I had to check online to make it work.
I have imported only one python module -> Random for this game.
This was required for selecting the toss result and making choices for the Computer in single player game.
Other than that, I have tried not to use any other modules for this implementation. 
I would call this attempt amateurish and would like to improve the implementation in future.
But for now, this is the game I would like to share with everyone.

## Installation
- Install python 3 on your system. 
- Clone this repo locally.
- Directly run the game using `python3 game.py` in your terminal
